## libpastry Integration — Approach

Refs: #39|Draft

### Goal
Integrate libpastry for frosted glass effects, spring animations, and spinners across the installer UI.

### Proposed approach
1. Add libpastry as a Flatpak module in `org.bootcinstaller.Installer.json`
2. Create `bootc_installer/utils/pastry_compat.py` wrapper (may already exist as stub)
3. Apply frosted glass to: welcome screen background, progress screen overlay, credits window
4. Replace the spinners that show load progress with libpastry animated spinners
5. Add spring animations to carousel transitions and button press feedback

### Files to touch
- `org.bootcinstaller.Installer.json` (add libpastry module)
- `bootc_installer/utils/pastry_compat.py` (wrapper/facade)
- `bootc_installer/views/progress.py` (frosted glass overlay)
- `bootc_installer/windows/dialog_credits.py` (frosted glass)
- `bootc_installer/views/welcome.py` (frosted glass)
- `.blp` UI templates (glass CSS classes)

### Open questions
- libpastry API stability — which version to target?
- Performance impact on low-end hardware?
- Fallback when libpastry is unavailable?
