# Frontend parity

The GNOME frontend is the reference: it is the one that shipped and has
end-to-end tests. This page records what each of the other four renders
of the same contract. Each gap then shows as a line here, not as a surprise on an
ISO. `docs/DESIGN-AUDIT.md` covers how each looks against its desktop;
this page covers what each does.

## Branding copy keys

Every key in `shared/branding/copy-defaults.json` is a line a product may
rebrand. A frontend "renders" a key when the line appears where the table
says. "Hidden" means the frontend shows nothing for an empty value. "No"
means the frontend shows its own hardcoded text, so a product cannot
rebrand that line.

`tests/unit/test_copy_coverage.py` enforces the "no" cells. It scans each
frontend for every key and compares what it finds against its own
`KNOWN_GAPS` table. An unlisted gap fails the test. So does a listed gap
that the frontend has since closed. Before that check, four cells here
claimed a render that nobody had wired up.

The eight `encryption_*` keys name the four types of encryption in the
recipe. The order of the types is the `encryption.type` enum in
`shared/recipe/fisherman-recipe.schema.json`. All five frontends use the same
words on the encryption page and on the confirm page.
`tests/unit/test_encryption_choices.py` makes sure that each frontend offers
those types in that order.

The confirm pages used to disagree. KDE showed "None" and "Passphrase
(LUKS)". GNOME showed its own phrases. COSMIC, Niri and Xfce showed the
recipe id, for example `luks-passphrase`. GNOME has a switch and a TPM
switch, not a list. Thus it shows only the two descriptions that its
switches can select.

The twelve `step_*` keys label the install step that runs. fisherman puts a
stable `step_id` on each step event, and each frontend reads the key
`step_<step_id>`. An event without a `step_id`, or an id with no copy line,
shows fisherman's `step_name`.

Before this, Niri showed the raw step name.
GNOME, Xfce, KDE and COSMIC each had their own table of the same words, so a
product could not change them. Those tables stay only as the fallback for a
fisherman without `step_id`. All five also draw the bar from fisherman's
`overall_pct` (`shared/progress/README.md`). Thus the bar now moves during
the Flatpak copy, where the old calculation in each frontend stopped.
XFCE hides its step label when it repeats the page title, which is the case
for `step_install_os` with the default copy.

The `validate_*` keys word fisherman's problems. Each frontend sends its
fields to `fisherman validate --json --partial -` while the user types and
shows each problem through the key `validate_<code>`
(`shared/recipe/README.md`). The codes are fisherman's
(`fisherman/docs/VALIDATE.md`), so the table has one row for the family. A
code with no copy line shows fisherman's own message. Before this, only
XFCE checked the hostname, and a username such as `root` failed after the
OS was on disk.

Outside the contract, under `extensions.gnome`: the tour page text, the
install video and the credits file. They are the last GNOME-only features.
The plan is to port the tour artwork (welcome and complete images) to the
other four. Video and credits then leave the contract; nothing else gets
them.

All five render the identity keys (`name`, `id`, `default_hostname`, URLs);
see `shared/branding/README.md`. Off live media, all five select the leaf
of `default_image` at the start (`shared/catalog/README.md`).

<!-- features:end -->

`shared/walkthrough/features.py` writes this table. Do not edit it here.
Each frontend has a manifest with one cell for each row:
`frontends/<name>/features.json`, and `shared/walkthrough/features-gnome.json`
for GNOME. `shared/walkthrough/feature-rows.json` has the rows.

To change a cell, edit the manifest of that frontend and run
`python3 shared/walkthrough/features.py`.
`tests/unit/test_parity_features.py` fails when the table and the manifests
do not agree. Some rows have evidence: a walkthrough screen or an E2E job.
For those rows, the test also fails when a cell says "yes" and the evidence
is not there.

The cells were read from the code on 2026-11-10, after #280 gave the other
four frontends a catalog, gates, locale pages and a companion.

## Closing the gaps, in order

1. ~~**Encryption set** (KDE, XFCE)~~ — **not a gap.** Both offer TPM and
   TPM + passphrase today. Each hides the two choices when fisherman's
   `tpm.usable` is false. No CI runner has a TPM. The capture thus showed
   only two of the choices, and this table copied it. The captures now read
   `shared/probe/fixtures/laptop.json`, which has a usable TPM, so they show
   all four.
2. ~~**Progress bar**~~ — **closed.** All five read
   `shared/progress/README.md` now. This entry said that fisherman emits
   `[n/9]`. It does not. Three frontends used that claim, so their bars
   stayed at zero. Their fixtures used the same shape, so the pictures
   showed a bar that moved. Drive the bar from `cumulative_pct`, not from
   `step / total_steps`: `total_steps` changes with the recipe, and one
   step takes 87% of the time.
3. ~~**Recovery key page**~~ — closed. fisherman prints the key after TPM
   enrolment. GNOME shows a page. The other four show a panel on the done
   screen. Each holds the restart button until the user acknowledges the
   key (#129).
4. ~~**User account**~~ — closed. All five have the step, and each shows
   it only when the image needs an account. All five create an account
   when the catalog does not set `needs_user_creation` (#288). On live
   media, all five read the flag from the leaf of `live.live_image`
   (#288). All five use the groups of `shared/account/` (#302). All five
   ask for the password two times, hold Next on a mismatch and have a
   reveal control (#295).
   The strength hint is not part of the contract. GNOME and KDE show
   one. fisherman does not check the strength, and the hint stops no
   install. A frontend can add one, but no frontend must.
5. **Store and tour assets**: only worth it where the desktop has a place
   for artwork. Every resolver already resolves the keys, so this is view
   work only. KDE and COSMIC now show `welcome_image` and
   `complete_image` as the welcome and done artwork, ahead of `logo`.
6. **Companion and locale steps**: only GNOME has a companion. It sends
   the account over TLS on the LAN address, with a single-use token in a
   header. XFCE and COSMIC had a companion over plain HTTP and removed it
   (#293). All five have locale pages. Each one now sends the
   choice to the installed system in the recipe's `locale`, `keyboard` and
   `timezone` (#292, tuna-os/fisherman#405), and only a choice: without
   one the image keeps its own value. Windows data migration (slurp) is not
   an installer feature at all: it belongs to wootc, and no frontend here
   offers it.
