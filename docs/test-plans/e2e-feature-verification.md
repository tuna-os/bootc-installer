Refs: #41|Closes

## Test Layers

| Layer | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `pytest tests/unit/ -q` | Pure-logic, no display (210+ tests) |
| 2 | `xvfb-run pytest tests/ui/ -v` | Headless GTK, real widgets (14+ tests) |
| 3 | `BOOTC_DEMO=1 ./run-dev.sh` | Full UI flow, fake install |
| 4 | `flatpak run org.bootcinstaller.Installer` | Real sandbox, real GResource |
| 5 | Hardware lab deploy + real install | Real fisherman, real disk (#42) |
| 6 | Post-reboot verification | Installed system validates (#42) |
