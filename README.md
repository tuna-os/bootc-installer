## Frontends

This repository is the monorepo for all TunaOS and Bluefin installer frontends.
They share the fisherman backend, the recipe schema and the screen contract in [`shared/`](shared/).
CI renders all five frontends in [`docs/walkthrough/`](docs/walkthrough/README.md).

| Frontend | Path | Toolkit | Walkthrough |
|---|---|---|---|
| GNOME | `bootc_installer/` | GTK4 / libadwaita (Python) | [docs/gui-walkthrough.md](docs/gui-walkthrough.md) |
| KDE Plasma | `frontends/kde/` | Qt 6 / Kirigami | [frontends/kde/docs/gui-walkthrough.md](frontends/kde/docs/gui-walkthrough.md) |
| COSMIC | `frontends/cosmic/` | libcosmic (Rust) | [frontends/cosmic/docs/gui-walkthrough.md](frontends/cosmic/docs/gui-walkthrough.md) |
| Niri | `frontends/niri/` | Quickshell QML + Go | [frontends/niri/docs/gui-walkthrough.md](frontends/niri/docs/gui-walkthrough.md) |
| XFCE | `frontends/xfce/` | GTK3 / PyGObject | [frontends/xfce/docs/gui-walkthrough.md](frontends/xfce/docs/gui-walkthrough.md) |

CI moves a release from `dev` to `prod` when all checks pass: [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md).
