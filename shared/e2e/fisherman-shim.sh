# The fisherman every frontend launches in the end-to-end job.

# Installed at /usr/local/bin/fisherman, which is the path all five frontends
# run (sudo outside Flatpak, pkexec inside). It is NOT a fake backend: the
# recipe the frontend hands over is validated by the REAL fisherman built
# from the submodule (`fisherman validate`, the same Validate() the install
# path runs first), and the recipe is kept so a later job can run the real
# install against a loop disk in a VM. What this shim does not do is
# partition the runner it is on: after validating, it streams the progress
# events a real install emits, so the frontend's progress parsing, log
# persistence and done-page transition run against the real protocol.
#
# "The real protocol" was not true when this was written. The shim streamed
# nine "[n/9] Partitioning ..." lines, described in the comment below as
# "the step lines a real run prints". fisherman prints no such lines: it
# writes newline-delimited JSON to stdout and nothing else
# (shared/progress/README.md). Two frontends parsed the invented prefix, so
# their progress bars never moved on a real install — and this gate, the one
# check whose whole purpose is to drive each frontend's real backend path,
# fed them the invented format and passed.

# The events a real run emits: fisherman's stdout protocol, verbatim in shape
# (internal/progress/progress.go). Step names, weights and cumulative
# percentages are those of an uncached auto-layout install, the same profile
# shared/progress/dry-run-transcript.ndjson was generated from. total_steps
# is 8 here and is NOT a constant — fisherman computes it from the recipe.
#
# Like a current fisherman (tuna-os/fisherman#270), every step, substep and
# complete event carries overall_pct, the bar position fisherman computes
# (internal/progress/bar.go), and every step event its stable step_id. The
# overall_pct values below are what that Tracker emits for this exact stream:
# a unit test (tests/unit/test_e2e_shim.py) replays the shim's events through
# the reference parser with the field stripped and requires the same bar.
# Frontends show overall_pct and label the step from the copy key
# step_<step_id>; the e2e runners still require the bar to end at 100%.
#
# A frontend that shows a moving bar against this is parsing the protocol. A
# frontend that shows an empty one is not, which is the point of the gate.
