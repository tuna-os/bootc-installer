"""No frontend looks for live media or offline stores itself, or writes the
recipe to a file (ROADMAP.md, Consolidation plan F3).

fisherman answers both on the host: `fisherman probe --json` reports
`live` and `offline`, and an install whose recipe leaves
additionalImageStores out exposes the host's stores itself
(fisherman#276). Four frontends used to search for the stores inside their
Flatpak sandbox, where the host's /etc and /usr are not visible, and GNOME
treated every ostree host as live media because it read /run/ostree-booted.
And every frontend wrote the recipe, LUKS passphrase included, to a
temporary file; fisherman now reads it on stdin (`fisherman -`).

The scan reads each frontend's own code with comments (and Rust test
modules) removed, the way tests/unit/test_shared_probe.py does for lsblk.
