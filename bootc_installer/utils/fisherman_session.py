"""GTK-free fisherman process-lifecycle adapter.

Owns everything about running the privileged fisherman helper that is not
GTK: staging (delegated to fisherman_runner), argv construction (ditto),
launching and polling the subprocess, tailing its log file for new lines,
and securely deleting the recipe file once the install finishes.

`bootc_installer.views.progress.BootcProgress` is the GTK consumer: it owns
the widget state (progress bar, video, console) and the GLib timers that
call into this adapter, but it does not itself touch os.unlink, subprocess,
or file descriptors for the fisherman transport. That split is what makes
this module importable, and testable, without a display.

apply_progress_event() in progress_parser.py remains the protocol-translation
boundary; this module only decides *when* to hand it a line, not how to
interpret one.
