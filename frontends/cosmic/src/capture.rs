//! Screenshot harness for `docs/screenshots` and the README walkthrough.
//!
//! Why this lives inside the binary rather than beside it: libcosmic is
//! iced-on-wgpu, so the only trustworthy source of "what the user sees" is the
//! frame wgpu actually presented. `iced::window::screenshot` reads that frame
//! back off the GPU. An external X11 grab would also work, but it can hand you
//! a valid PNG of a surface that never acquired a real adapter. Reading back
//! the presented frame cannot.
//!
//! Two properties matter and are enforced in `audit`:
//!
//!  * SAFETY. Driving the wizard to the install page must never start an
//!    install. In `tuna-installer-xfce` the page-enter hook called
//!    `start_install()`, so a naive capture would have partitioned the CI
//!    runner's disk. Here the harness assigns `page` directly and never emits
//!    `Message::StartInstall`, and `update()` refuses that message outright
//!    while `capture` is `Some`. Every hardware query is replaced by fixtures.
//!
//!  * HONESTY. A blank page is a perfectly good 65 KB PNG.
//!    `bootc-installer-asahi` shipped a completely empty settings screen behind
//!    a green tick because its check asserted only that the files existed and
//!    were non-empty. So we read the pixels back and assert properties that
//!    only hold when the UI really drew, with thresholds calibrated against
//!    measured output from real renders.

// Two things this exercise actually taught, both of which would have been

//
//   * `largest-flat` is the WEAKEST signal here, not the strongest. Real pages
//     reach 98.2% and a blank one is 99.4% — barely a point apart, because a
//     sparse dark page genuinely is almost all one colour. It is kept only as
//     a backstop. Colour count is the sharp discriminator: 8 versus 172+.
//   * Measured over the WHOLE frame these numbers do not separate at all. The
//     COSMIC header bar draws either way, which alone scored a blank page
//     1.57% ink and 98.4% flat — inside the range real pages occupy. Hence
//     HEADER_SKIP_PX.
//
// The sibling repo's first attempt guessed 0.97 for largest-flat and then
// failed a page that had rendered perfectly. Guessing a threshold and reading
// the resulting failure as a defect is how you end up "fixing" working code.
