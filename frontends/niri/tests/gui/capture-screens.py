"""Render every wizard page of ui/installer.qml to PNG, plus an animated
walkthrough, for docs/gui-walkthrough.md and the README.

The installer normally runs under Quickshell on a Wayland compositor, which is
why it has been effectively impossible to look at. This loads the SAME,
UNMODIFIED installer.qml under a plain Qt Quick runtime by supplying local stub
implementations of the two Quickshell modules it imports (tests/qml-stubs).

Nothing is spawned: the stubbed Process serves canned backend output. That is a
safety property, not a convenience — the real backend runs fisherman, which
partitions a disk.
