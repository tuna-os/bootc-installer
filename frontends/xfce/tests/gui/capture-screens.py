# Product branding is resolved from the host's os-release, so an unpinned

# renders "Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS", and the main-branch job commits
# those PNGs into docs/. Pin it so the committed walkthrough is stable and
# says the family name, exactly as it did before branding became dynamic.
# On a real Skipjack ISO the same attributes read "Skipjack" instead.
#
# This has to happen BEFORE tuna_installer_xfce.core is imported: core
# resolves the whole Branding object once at import and every copy key is
# formatted from it. Setting core.PRODUCT_NAME afterwards pinned only the
# one f-string that reads it, which is why the committed walkthrough said
# "Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.5 LTS This assistant installs TunaOS" -- the
# runner's name and the pinned one, in the same sentence.
#
# Pin the whole object rather than BOOTC_INSTALLER_PRODUCT_NAME, which covers
# `name` alone and leaves os-release's LOGO and assets showing through.
# setdefault, so a workflow pointing at a real product's file still wins.
# REPO here is the frontend tree, not the monorepo root, so reach the shared
